# PDF-Driven Chatbot

This project implements a **PDF-Driven Chatbot** built using **Streamlit**, **LangChain**, and **Google Generative AI APIs**. The chatbot extracts text from uploaded PDF documents, processes it into retrievable chunks, and provides context-aware responses to user queries.

---

## ‚ú® Features
- **PDF Parsing**: Extracts text content from user-uploaded PDF files.
- **Text Chunking**: Splits extracted text into manageable chunks with overlap for context retention.
- **Semantic Embeddings**: Generates embeddings using Google Generative AI embeddings.
- **FAISS Integration**: Efficient similarity search for text retrieval.
- **Conversational Memory**: Maintains chat context using LangChain's memory module.
- **Interactive UI**: Built with Streamlit for a seamless experience.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Streamlit**: For building the user interface.
- **PyPDF2**: For PDF text extraction.
- **LangChain**: Utilities for text processing and conversational chains.
- **FAISS**: Scalable vector storage and similarity search.
- **Google Generative AI**:
  - `GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings` for embedding generation.
  - `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` for generating conversational responses.

## üöÄ How It Works
1. **Upload PDFs**: Users upload PDF documents through the sidebar.
2. **Process PDFs**:
   - Text is extracted and split into chunks.
   - Chunks are embedded using Google Generative AI embeddings.
   - A FAISS vector store is created for efficient retrieval.
3. **Interactive Chat**:
   - Users can ask questions about the content of the uploaded PDFs.
   - The chatbot retrieves relevant information and provides contextually aware responses.

   cd pdf-driven-chatbot
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Add your Google API Key in .streamlit/secrets.toml file:
   ```bash
   GOOGLE_API_KEY = "your-google-api-key"
   ```

## Running the App
Start the Streamlit application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
